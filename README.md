# Rentify--
Rentify - Real Estate Rental Platform Overview Rentify is a web application designed to connect property owners (sellers) with potential tenants (buyers). The platform allows sellers to list their properties, manage their listings, and interact with interested buyers. Buyers can browse available properties, filter listings based on various criteria, and express interest in properties they like.

Tech Stack Frontend: React, HTML, CSS Backend: Node.js, Express.js Database: MongoDB (Mongoose for ORM) Application Features Part I: Basic Application (Mandatory) User Authentication

Users can register and log in. Users can be either sellers or buyers. Property Management for Sellers

Sellers can post properties with essential details (e.g., location, area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, nearby amenities). Sellers can view, update, and delete their posted properties. Sellers can view all posted rental properties. Property Browsing for Buyers

Buyers can browse all available properties. Buyers can apply filters to narrow down property searches based on criteria such as location, number of bedrooms, etc. Buyers can express interest in a property by clicking the "I'm Interested" button, which reveals the seller's details. Part II: Add-On Features (Advanced) Pagination and Form Validation

Implement pagination for property listings to enhance user experience. Add form validation to ensure all required property details are entered correctly. Enhanced Authentication

Require buyers to log in to view seller details. Redirect unauthorized users attempting to access seller information to the login screen. Like Feature

Add a "Like" button to each property. Track and display the count of likes live. Email Notifications

Send an email to the buyer with the seller's contact details when the "I'm Interested" button is clicked. Notify the seller via email with the details of the interested buyer. Setup Instructions Prerequisites Node.js MongoDB Installation Clone the repository:
